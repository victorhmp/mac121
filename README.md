# MAC121 - Algorithms and Data Structures I

This repository contains my programming assignments for the discipline "MAC121 - Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados I".

Note: implementation heavilly rely on the Standard Libraries from "Computer Science - An Interdisciplinary Approach" and "Algorithms 4th Edition" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

Discipline ministered by Professor Yoshiharu Kohayakawa during the second semester of 2017.
